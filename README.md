# 🚀 DBT Implementation with  Snowflake

This repository demonstrates how to implement **dbt (Data Build Tool)** with **Snowflake** for building modern, scalable data transformation pipelines.

---

## 📖 What is dbt?
**dbt** is an open-source tool that allows data analysts and engineers to:
- Transform data in your warehouse using **SQL**
- Apply **version control** via Git
- Create **modular, testable, and maintainable** transformation logic
- Generate **data lineage** and documentation automatically

Think of dbt as the **T** in the modern **ELT** process:  
**Extract → Load → Transform (dbt)**.
